# BCC Design System Library
This library is a collection of tokens and components that conform to the BCC Design System.

> **Note** This is the Vue implementation, for the CSS-only library [see here](./css-package/README.md)

## Installation & Usage
Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-design/design-library) for installation instructions and to [Storybook](https://design-library.developer.bcc.no) for interactive example of the components and their variants (view the [dev Storybook](https://design-library-dev.developer.bcc.no) for unreleased changes).

## Developing the package locally
### Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins:
  - [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
  - [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

### Prerequisites
This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which you need to install before usage. The easiest way is to install it with npm:
```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Get started
Install dependencies:
```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Then run Storybook when developing components to have a live reloading server to test them:
```sh
pnpm storybook
```

Run a live reloading unit test server:
```sh
pnpm test:unit
```

Some unit test use [snapshots](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html). Be sure to update snapshots after updating a component that has such a test:
```sh
pnpm test:unit:update-snapshots
```

### Creating a new component
The repository contains a handy script for scaffolding a new component:
```sh
pnpm create-component ComponentName
```
This will create a Vue component, with accompanying test, stories and CSS files, and will also update the exports for the library.

### Building for production
To build the package for production, including types, run:
```sh
pnpm build
```

### Releasing a new version
A new version can be released by running the [Create New Version](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design/actions/workflows/design-library-create-version.yml) workflow from GitHub. This will update the version in the `package.json`, push a Git commit and tag, and create a new [release](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design/releases) in GitHub. Maintainers can publish this release, after which the new version will be pushed to npm with the `latest` tag.

All commits to master will be released under the `dev` tag on npm, so they can be tested and installed immediately even if a new release hasn't come out.

## Tokens
This repository includes a setup with tokens from the design system. These tokens are exported from Figma and can be found in `src/tokens/input/figma.json`.

To build the tokens from this source file, run:
```sh
pnpm build:tailwind
```

This will update the files of the Tailwind theme which can then be checked into Git.
