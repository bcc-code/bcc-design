# BCC Vue Component Library

This library is a collection of components that conform to the BCC Design System, implemented in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Installation
Install the `dev` version which points to the latest commit on the `main` branch:
```
npm install @bcc-code/bcc-vue-components@dev
```

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

Add the following to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
        ["cva\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
    ]
```

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
