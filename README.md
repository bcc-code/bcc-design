## Installation & Usage
Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-design/vue-components/) for installation instructions and to [Storybook](https://vue-components-storybook.developer.bcc.no) for interactive example of the components and their variants.

## Developing the package locally
### Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins:
  - [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
  - [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

### Get started
Install dependencies:
```sh
npm ci
```

Then run Storybook when developing components to have a live reloading server to test them:
```sh
npm run storybook
```

Run a live reloading unit test server:
```sh
npm run test:unit
```

Some unit test use [snapshots](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html). Be sure to update snapshots after updating a component that has such a test:
```sh
npm run test:update-snapshots
```

### Creating a new component
The repository contains a handy script for scaffolding a new component:
```sh
npm run create-component ComponentName
```
This will create a Vue component, with an accompanying test and stories file, and will also update the exports for the library.

### Building for production
To build the package for production, including types and icons, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
