# Getting Started
The design system consists of a set of [guidelines](../guidelines.md), tokens and components. These are implemented in CSS and we offer a Vue wrapper around the CSS library as well.

- [Vue components](./vue-components.md) when using Vue 3
- [CSS library](./css-library.md) when not using Vue 3.
