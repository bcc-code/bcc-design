## Quick installation
Install the `dev` version which points to the latest commit on the `main` branch:
```sh
npm install @bcc-code/vue-components@dev
```

You can set the version in your `package.json` to `dev` to ensure you always get the latest version:

```json
    "@bcc-code/vue-components": "dev",
```

4. Run `npm install` with the desired package version.
