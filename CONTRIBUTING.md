# How to contribute to the BCC design system

We welcome contributions from the community! In fact, large parts of the design system are maintained by open source contributors. Besides this guide, check out these pages:
- [Design Library Contributing Guide](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-design/design-library/contributing.html)
- [BCC Coding Guide](https://developer.bcc.no/guides/coding-guide.html)

### Did you find a bug?
- If you found a **security vulnerability**, refer to our [security policy](https://developer.bcc.no/security/index.html).
- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or functionality to one of the design system libraries?
- Be sure there is an issue tracking your feature. If you're looking for a good way to start, find one of the **issues marked [good first issue](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22good+first+issue%22)**.
- Leave a comment on GitHub or the `#bcc-design-system` channel on [Discord](https://developer.bcc.no/get-involved.html) when you pick something up, or if you have a question about a certain issue.
- If you want to contribute to the [design library](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-design/design-library/), be sure to read its [Contributing Guide](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-design/design-library/contributing.html).

### Do have a different question?
The `#bcc-design-system` channel on [Discord](https://developer.bcc.no/get-involved.html) is the best way to get in touch with other developers that contribute to and use the design system.
